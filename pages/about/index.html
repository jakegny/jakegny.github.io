    <pre><code class="clojure">(def engineer "One who builds.")
</code></pre><h2 id="the-why--motivation">The Why / Motivation</h2><p>The sales pitch:</p><p>Are you tired of buggy software and medicore products? I know I am. The thing is, no one starts out make something anyone would consider mediocre. Why would you? It's demoralizing. So why does it seem like more and more every app we use, every website we visit, even the roads we drive on keep breaking down. There are more potholes that ever before. Why is that happening?</p><h3 id="the-acceptance-of-mediocrity">The acceptance of mediocrity.</h3><p>Or, put another way, people are encouraged to cut corners. Have you said, or heard someone say, *"We need to meet this deadline, we don't have time to fix X, Y, or Z / test that / Address the tech debt. It's <em>good enough</em>."</p><hr /><p>My driving goal in life as best I can currently define it is:</p><blockquote><p>To educate, in simple terms, so that the world can evolve.</p></blockquote><p>My main frustration in the world today is an acceptance of mediocrity. I see it every day. Not just in my work, but in the world around me. I will likely focus on this in future posts/videos.</p><p>My goal with this blog is to provide context, tools, and patterns that can be easily understood and applied to the real world development practices</p><p>I will also be using this blog to document progress on the various projects I will be working on. Partially to keep me accountable, but also in the hopes that maybe some of the things I hope to provide for free to the public for anyway to use could be supported here.</p><hr /><h2 id="the-name">The Name</h2><p>Every good Clojure programmer knows you have to start with defining your terms. So that's where I will start.</p><p><strong>def</strong></p><blockquote><p><em>(adj.) excellent</em></p></blockquote><p><strong>engineer</strong></p><blockquote><p><em>(noun) a person who designs, <ins>builds</ins>, or maintains engines, machines, or public works.</em></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><em>(verb) <ins>design and build</ins> (a machine or structure)</em></p></blockquote><p>First, <code>def</code> is a special form (keyword) in Clojure. It is the mechanism for associating values with a symbol ("variables"). It is short for <em>define</em>.</p><p>Second, I am an "engineer". My focus is on <em>building</em> things.</p><p>Third, I think alliteration is fun. So I can read the name as "Excellent Engineer".</p><p>Fourth, def is easily confused with, and sounds like, <em>deaf</em>. As in problems with hearing. Recently I found out I have some hearing loss and it is likely to get worse. This happened at the same time I was tossing around the idea a blog / tutorial.</p><p>All of these things happened to align and thus <code>(def engineer)</code> was born.</p><h2 id="about-me">About Me</h2><p>My day job is as a Technical Lead in the healthcare industry. I work primarily with Javascript, Java, and Python. I have a particular interest in AI, most specifically around NLP. I have one proper research project I am working on (off and on) that I call "programmatic truthiness". Everyone knows you can definitly trust everything you read on the internet, right? Of course not! So, the obvious follow up to that is, what can I trust? Well this project is to provide a programatic "score" to natural language to say whether or not the material seems "trust worthy" based on certain Criterion of Truth.</p><p>Most of my projects I will be talking about will be in Clojure.</p><blockquote><p>"It may be that Clojure is the language for cranky tired old programmers. And you know what? I would not be embarassed if it was." - Rich Hickey</p></blockquote><p>Clojure was built by, and is maintained by, people who's primary goal is to help other people "build things".</p>
